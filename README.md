# VoxGuardian

VoxGuardian is a real-time AI tool for 911 dispatch centers that flags suspicious or synthetic emergency calls. It runs silently in the background, providing live audio integrity signals like transcription confidence, emotion tone, and speaker anomaliesâ€”without interrupting human operators.
This app was created automatically by Base44.
It's a Vite+React app that communicates with the Base44 API.
